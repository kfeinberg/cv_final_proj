#TODO: iterate through images, for each pair of image use algos to calculate speed
#TODO: maybe returns all the images with the speed labelled on them?
#TODO: maybe have command line arguments? if they input just one directory 
# we do physics way
# and if we they do 2 directories then we do camera projection algo way
